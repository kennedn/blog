# kindlepass
Audible devices/apps require that a license file be present to allow the playback of audible content.

As it stands, the Audible/Amazon login flow has changed so much that older Kindle models (1, 2, DX & 3), can no longer log in and retrieve this license by themselves.

**kindlepass** is designed to streamline the retrieval of licenses for these devices.

## Features
- Windows / Linux Support
- Auto-detection of plugged-in Kindles on Linux
- Full CLI wizard
- Install licenses directly to device
- Generate activation bytes, allowing native playback

## How to run

### Prerequisites
- Python >=3.6

Download this project by either running `git clone git@github.com:kennedn/kindlepass.git`
or downloading the tarball [here](https://github.com/kennedn/kindlepass/archive/master.zip).
  
You can then run pip install from within the project directory to install kindlepass and dependancies:
```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```
Then run the wizard:
```bash
kindlepass
```
If you encounter errors you may need to install some user level packages to resolve dependancies:
```bash
python3 -m pip -U Pillow psutil
```

### Serial
If prompted, you can find your Devices serial by Navigating to
Menu --> Settings --> Device Info --> Serial Number:

kindlepass                                       | On Device

### Usage
The tool will present a list of options once auto-detection / serial input is complete:
```bash
#  ACTION                                        
1  Activate device (Will require login to Amazon)
2  Save to Device                                
3  Save to file                                  
4  Print activation bytes                        
5  Exit Program
```
#### Activate device
This option will take you through a list of prompts to login to Amazon. After a successful login, activation will
be retrieved and processed.

#### Save to Device (Linux Only)
This option will allow you to save the `AudibleActivation.sys` file directly to your kindle.

#### Save to File
This option will allow you to save the `AudibleActivation.sys` file to a specific location. This will then need placed
manually on the Kindle device at `ROOT:/system/AudibleActivation.sys`.

#### Print activation bytes
Activation bytes can be used to play .aax files natively or convert to other formats, example commands:

Play Natively:
```bash
mpv --demuxer-lavf-o=activation_bytes=XXXXXXXX audiobook.aax
```
Convert to MP3:
```bash
ffmpeg -activation_bytes XXXXXXXX -i audiobook.aax -c copy audiobook.m4b
```

### Transferring Audiobooks

There is no direct way to obtain audiobooks from audible on older kindles. You must instead download and then transfer the .aax files to your kindle manually following these steps:

- Navigate to your audible library, [here](https://www.audible.co.uk/library/titles).
- Download the relevant titles in .aax format
- Plug-in and transfer the files to your Kindle under `ROOT:/audible/`. Create this folder if required.

### Additional Notes
Kindle auto-detection will not function on Windows and Mac OS systems.
